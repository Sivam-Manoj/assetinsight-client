This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Appraiser CRM

Enabled CRM agents now have a compact `/crm` workspace with paginated tasks,
follow-ups and attachments, lead creation, coverage, transfers, email tools and
explicit Outlook export. Deploy the additive backend summary/detail/history reads
first. See [CRM workflow, performance and verification notes](docs/crm.md).

### Asset/Lot activity metadata

Both forms queue owner-scoped operational observations in IndexedDB: imports,
lot/photo removal and ordering, cover changes, logo choices and explicit draft
saves. Draft restoration establishes a baseline, not a new import or deletion.
No photo bytes or unfinished field values are added to this queue, and ordinary
text changes do not generate keystroke events. Server-side preview/report
transitions provide the confirmed saved-change history.

While signed in and foregrounded, reconnect/periodic sync sends at most 100 events
and 256 KiB to `/api/report-activity/events`, with stable event IDs and an explicit
owner fence. Only acknowledged IDs are removed. This never uploads media or starts
report submission. Account changes abort sync and preserve the old owner's queue.
The optional `activity_id` links normal/Smart Upload submissions to local history;
existing submission/session retry identities and report limits are unchanged.
Backend support must be deployed first. No new package is required.

### Incoming contracts: generate and start a new lot

Asset and Lot Listing forms opened from Incoming include **Generate files & new
lot** alongside their ordinary create action. It submits the current media through
the existing analysis pipeline; it does not skip preview, approval or release.
After the upload is accepted, the client sends the accepted report ID to
`POST /auctioneer/work-items/:id/continue` and opens a fresh form of the same type.
Imported contract, customer, event and location details come from the server;
photos, videos, annotations, source-lot mappings and submission/draft identity
are not reused. The original Schedule A form remains locked to its assigned lots;
the continuation is a new unknown lot, not another copy of the Schedule A.

If opening the next form fails, the accepted report remains accepted. **Retry open
new form** repeats only the idempotent continuation request. If another tab has
already used that successor, the UI offers Reports rather than an empty form
under an old submission ID. Ordinary create actions still open Previews. Saving
a new imported draft preserves its work-item reference, and reopening validates
the current setup and exact saved submission identity before enabling editing.
An upload placeholder marked `report_created` can resume only when the backend
explicitly advertises `canResumeUpload: true`; accepted reports cannot. Legacy ordinary drafts keep
their existing behavior.

Backend continuation/setup support must be deployed first. Focused coverage is
in `services/auctioneer.test.ts`, `components/forms/auctioneerContinuation.test.ts`,
`components/forms/ReportFormPage.test.tsx` and both Asset/Lot Listing workflow
suites. Tests use synthetic fixtures, with no live Auctioneer delivery or report
generation required.

### Failed Asset and Lot Listing preview recovery

The preview queue and report deep links keep Preview available after generation
failure when the API advertises `preview_available` (with legacy data fallback).
Opening does not retry work. The editor retains a failure warning and saves edits
on the same report; its final action uses resubmit for error states. All stored
lots/media remain available for review. Reports without saved preview data link
to Drafts instead of offering an empty preview or an unusable file-generation
retry. Generation/download readiness is not inferred from preview availability.

### Asset preview required selections

Asset previews support Running Condition, Completeness and Legal choices for
selected lots, the current 20-lot page, or every lot. Selection persists across
pagination; each Apply changes only its named group, not other choices, lot
numbers, descriptions or media. Each lot retains compact individual overrides,
including N/A. Running/Working Condition specs update alongside the selected
condition and are suppressed for N/A. The existing saved
`condition_report_selections` contract is unchanged.

Selection clears after save/reload, photo round trips, or adding/deleting lots,
so index-based targets cannot accidentally refer to changed rows. Applying a
choice reports inline status without stacking mobile notifications. Save and
submit remain explicit; bulk editing never queues files. Lot Listing controls
are unchanged. Focused tests: `components/reports/PreviewModal.test.tsx` and
`lib/assetConditionSelections.test.ts`; browser coverage is in
`e2e/clearvalue.smoke.spec.ts`.

### Salvage review workflow

Saved previews optionally include backend-built `report_enrichment` v1: localized executive summary, assignment/condition, repair provenance, comparable verification, calculations, evidence/photo review, checklist, revision history and references. Web displays its supplied paragraphs and tables without recomputing values or promoting research notes into facts. The optional preview-only `report_context` editor collects explicitly appraiser-supplied narrative context. Saves use the existing `baseRevision`; omitted context keys retain prior notes and blank/null clears a note. The serializer allowlists context fields and never sends enrichment, evidence or original media as edits. Context saves do not trigger paid research. Focused coverage: `components/reports/SalvageReportEnrichment.test.tsx` and `e2e/salvage-enrichment.spec.ts`.

Accepted Salvage uploads close the capture drawer and open `/salvage/status/[id]`, a durable processing workspace showing saved workflow steps. Completion stays on that page: the owner must click **Open preview** to visit `/salvage/preview/[id]`. Accepted Submit/Resubmit and explicit Research again close the editor and return to progress. Reports and Previews link active/stopped work to the same tracker; reloading or reconnecting reads the persisted report and never starts another request automatically.

**Stop processing** uses `POST /salvage/:id/cancel` with the displayed `baseRevision` and `jobId`, not merely the report ID. The backend's `can_cancel`, `preview_available` and `workflow_steps` are authoritative. Cancelled runs preserve saved media/edits and cannot publish new files; already-dispatched processing may still incur charges. A completed preview can be reopened, edited and submitted. If the initial preview never completed, Resume processing reuses saved originals/checkpoints with the current revision rather than inventing a preview or requiring another upload. Cancellation/generation conflicts require refreshing the current run. No local abort is presented as a successful server cancellation.

Legacy reports retain their existing condition, damage, facility and cash/reserve editors. V2 Canadian assessments instead use typed `assessment_inputs`: subject/market/date, parts/labour/charges, seller deductions, supplied evidence and reasoned appraiser overrides. Conclusions are saved server calculations, not live browser estimates. Unknown amounts remain unavailable, and material subject edits mark the research stale. The legacy financial editor is hidden for v2 so two competing values cannot be submitted.

New Salvage intake supports 50 ordered photos and CAD by default. The capture form collects claim, province/market and loss context, not vehicle identity or engine specifications. Upload clear VIN/serial, engine, badge and dashboard photos; the backend provides optional versioned `assessment.vehicleDetails`, using the Excel catalogue for field definitions only. Preview shows readable photo values, explicit “Cannot find from image” states and conflicts, with source-photo inspection. Appraiser changes are sent only through `assessment_inputs.vehicleOverrides`; null explicitly clears a value. The backend preserves evidence and synchronizes identity fields. Changing vehicle category updates the workbook field list on save. Legacy assessments without photo-derived details retain their clearly labelled unverified identity editor.

**Research again** is a separately confirmed paid action with the saved revision and a session-persisted request ID. Unknown network outcomes reuse that ID. Saves, file submissions and refreshes never request paid research. Backend support must precede this client; new chart/report-body visual rollout and real-vehicle acceptance remain pending. The backend's authorized synthetic OCR/live-search smoke test passed on 2026-09-08; this does not establish valuation accuracy or complete export parity.

Downloads use authenticated PdfReport IDs returned by the backend and remain disabled until the required generation, approval and release are complete. Concurrent edits produce a revision conflict rather than overwriting another device's changes. Unsaved changes remain on screen until explicitly discarded or saved.

Focused verification: `npm test -- services/salvage.test.ts components/forms/SalvageForm.workflow.test.tsx components/reports/SalvagePreviewWorkspace.test.tsx components/reports/SalvageProgressWorkspace.test.tsx components/reports/SalvageVehicleDetails.test.tsx components/reports/SalvageAssessmentEditor.test.tsx` and `npm run test:e2e -- e2e/salvage-preview.spec.ts e2e/salvage-assessment.spec.ts e2e/salvage-progress.spec.ts`. The browser tests use isolated API/storage fixtures and do not call production providers.
