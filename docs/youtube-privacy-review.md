# YouTube privacy controls and production checklist

Implemented and deployed, 29 September 2026. The owner approved the public contact
`manom8193@gmail.com` and the additional review, revocation and cleanup controls.
Application deployment does not constitute Google approval or channel connection.

## Public pages

Exactly `/privacy` and `/terms/youtube` are public for anonymous, pending-device
and authenticated visitors. Protected report routes and neighboring paths remain
gated. Both are static server components without API calls, YouTube embeds or new
tracking. The security-data notice remains alongside the YouTube disclosures.

The notice describes shared administrator authority, encrypted credentials,
original video/audio/embedded metadata transfer, explicit per-video review and
Private/Unlisted/Public selection. Google Privacy, YouTube Terms, account-access
revocation and Studio links remain directly accessible without signing in.

Admin connection consent is not upload permission. Explicit report submission
only prepares a review record. A separate administrator video review authorizes
upload, with initial private visibility; public/unlisted changes still require
the current report to be approved and released. Original report media/ZIPs are
unchanged. Existing generated files need explicit regeneration for new links.

Revoke/erase controls stop future authorized work, request provider revocation
where possible, and remove the integration's cached credentials/channel/video
data in bounded maintenance. Pending work and uncertain provider outcomes are
not shown as completed. Manual confirmation of external Google revocation is
distinct from provider-confirmed revocation. Minimal suppression and operation
receipts remain. Historical report provenance, generated files, downloaded
copies, original media and YouTube-hosted videos are not silently rewritten or
deleted. Broader removal requests use the public contact. See backend
`docs/youtube-connection.md` for precise behavior and operational limitations.

## Rollout checklist

1. **Completed:** deploy backend API and report workers together, then admin and web. No new
   packages, migrations or automatic report regeneration are required. Keep all
   four optional YouTube settings consistent across API/workers; do not rotate
   encryption keys as part of this change.
2. **Completed:** verify anonymous and pending-device HTTP 200 and readable content at
   `https://assetinsightvaluator.com/privacy` and
   `https://assetinsightvaluator.com/terms/youtube`.
3. Save those exact URLs in the existing Google project's Branding settings;
   preserve the client ID, callback and scope. Do not publish a localhost URL.
4. Review Google production/verification requirements and provide genuine domain
   ownership and demo evidence. Pause for user authorization at Google consent
   or compliance declarations. Publishing the OAuth audience, sensitive-scope
   verification and YouTube's public-upload audit are separate requirements.
5. With explicit authorization, test one non-customer clip end to end. Local
   mocked tests do not prove Google grant, quota, channel access or public-upload
   eligibility. Do not upload customer originals as a smoke test.

The subsequent owner-authorized rollout completed with all six workers, API and
both frontend clusters healthy. Public pages are live; signed-in admin loaded
the new controls and refreshed the disconnected channel's status. No connection,
provider upload, Google publication or database repair was performed. Items 3–5
remain external activation steps. See backend
`docs/operations/youtube-release-2026-09-29.md` for release identities, rollback
retention, production smoke checks and query-safe callback access logging.

## Verification

Proxy tests cover anonymous, pending-device, access-cookie and refresh-cookie
readers and retained protected-path redirects. Static content tests check consent,
contact and accurate cleanup/visibility distinctions. The public-route E2E matrix
includes both pages. Record executed commands and browser checks at handoff;
added tests alone are not evidence of a passing run.

Executed locally on 29 September 2026 with environment-file reads and external
network access blocked: web typecheck, lint, production build and all 990 tests
passed; admin verification and all 90 policy tests passed; the frozen YouTube
backend integration/workflow gate passed all 190 tests, with backend typecheck,
build and report-workflow policy checks also passing.

The final full backend run completed with 2,666 passes and one failure in the
unchanged `admin-preview-resubmit.integration.test.ts:128`. Its raw-document
equality assertion raced rejected-request audit logging: only `activity_id`,
`activity_stream_id`, `activity_revision` and `activity_outbox` differed. Missing
FMV is rejected before the YouTube submission hook executes. This matches the
previously documented audit-equality race; no unrelated workflow or test was
changed. The full-suite gate is therefore not recorded as green.

Isolated production-browser checks covered exact per-video metadata, all three
visibility choices, fresh consent and reset-on-edit, accepted-versus-completed
status, cancelled removal, pending provider revocation after local cleanup,
manual external-revocation acknowledgement, keyboard dismissal/focus, narrow
320px layouts and dark mode. Public pages returned HTTP 200 for anonymous and
pending-device readers; protected neighboring paths still redirected. Keyboard
navigation between privacy and feature terms passed in both directions. Pointer
link activation could not be certified in the in-app browser; direct navigation,
link targets and keyboard activation passed. No live Google or customer media
was used. The test-only admin and API fixtures are not production evidence.
